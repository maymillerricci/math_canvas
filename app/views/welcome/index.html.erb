	<p>Math Canvas is a place where students can draw out solutions to math problems, using artwork to illustrate their individual thinking processes. </p>
	<p>Math Canvas promotes the following:</p>
	<ul class="intro_list">
		<li>Individuality -- each studentâ€™s process for solving a problem may be very different from others</li>
		<li>Creativity -- students represent their mathematical thinking using drawings and symbols, not just with numbers</li>
		<li>Learning from others -- students can see how others solve a problem, introducing them to alternative ways of thinking</li>
		<li>Critical thinking and problem solving -- drawing allows students to explain their thinking visually, with a focus on understanding how they get to the answer vs. just the answer itself</li>
	</ul>
